# EmotiChat: Chat with Your Feelings

Hey there! Welcome to **EmotiChat** – a project I built to create a chat experience that truly understands your mood. EmotiChat listens to your words and replies in a way that feels like talking with a friend.

## What’s EmotiChat All About?

EmotiChat uses sentiment analysis to pick up on the emotions in your text and then responds to match your mood. I’ve built my own custom model for this, but I’ve also included like BERT and RoBERTa.

## Key Features

- **Emotion Detection:** Figures out if you’re happy, sad, angry, or surprised.
- **Friendly, Tailored Responses:** Delivers replies that connect with your feelings instead of generic responses.
- **Model Flexibility:** Switch between my custom model, BERT, or RoBERTa for your sentiment analysis.
- **Real-Time Chat:** Enjoy instant responses that keep the conversation flowing.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive experience.
